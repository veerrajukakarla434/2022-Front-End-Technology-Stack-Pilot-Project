#### Unpaired Tags - Singular Tags

* Unpaired tags are single tags with no closing tag. These tags are also called Singular Tags. These are also called non-container tags because they do not contain any content.

* It is recommended to close the unpaired/singular tags also. But unfortunately, we do not have the closing tag for those. So, an unpaired tag is closed after adding a slash(/) just before the greater than > sign. For example: <br />.
