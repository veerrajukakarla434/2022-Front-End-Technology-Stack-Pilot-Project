## Setup JavaScript Development Environment

* Here, we are going to use JavaScript in developing a web application. So, we must have at least two things, **a browser**, and an **editor** to write the JavaScript code.
* Although we also need a webserver to run a web application, but we will use a single HTML web page to run our JavaScript code. So, no need to install it for now.

#### IDEs for JavaScript Application Development

* We can write JavaScript code using a simple editor like Notepad. However, you can install any open-sourced or licensed IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to get the advantage of IntelliSense support for JavaScript and syntax error/warning highlighter for rapid development.

#### JavaScript DOM 

* **What is DOM in JavaScript?**

* JavaScript can access all the elements in a webpage making use of Document Object Model (DOM). In fact, the web browser creates a DOM of the webpage when the page is loaded.  

* The DOM model is created as a tree of objects like this:
