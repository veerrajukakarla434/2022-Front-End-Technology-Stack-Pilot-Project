#### What is HTML ?
* HTML is an acronym which stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language** which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.

* **Hyper Text**: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.

* **Markup language**: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.

* **Web Page**: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.

* HTML was created by Tim **Berners-Lee** in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1999.
